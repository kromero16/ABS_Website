				<h2>Behavior Specialists</h2>
				<p>
					Better your child's quality of life and aptitude in social environments through intensive function-based treatment from certified behavior specialists. <b>Alternative Behavior Strategies, Inc. </b>(ABS) is a nationally recognized behavior modification consultation firm that utilizes the principles of <b>Applied Behavior Analysis</b> (ABA) to help children ages 2 to 18 alter social behaviors attributable to a pervasive developmental disorder or social emotional disorder.<br><br>

					<b>Applied Behavior Analysis</b> (ABA) is the application of the principles and technologies of Behavior Analysis for the betterment of an individual through the teaching of socially appropriate behaviors. From its infancy in the 20th century, scientists in the Behavior Analysis realm have studied how individuals learn, how the environment affects said learning, and the results of the interaction of the individual with the environment. By utilizing the principles of the research, <b>Board Certified Behavior Analysts</b> (BCBA) are able to look at an individual’s learning past, the environment with which the individual interacts including all the stimuli and variables it contains, and create a plan to help change the future occurrences of specific behaviors. Whether it is a inappropriate behavior such as tantruming, hitting, spitting or lack of appropriate behavior such as requesting, eating, or playing, BCBA’s can utilize the principles of ABA to teach (increase appropriate behaviors), replace (making appropriate behaviors more efficient than inappropriate behaviors), or decrease inappropriate behaviors. Utilizing reinforcers (e.g. praise, natural or contrived stimuli, etc.) and the motivation and desires of the child, BCBAs help the child to explore and learn from the natural environment. ABA has continuously been shown through research to be an effective tool in helping individuals learn and change behaviors in all aspects of their lives.<br> <br>

				<h2>Our Process</h2>
				<p>
					Through a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques and ABA strategies that incorporate motivation and self-awareness, <b>ABS</b> addresses each behavioral and skill domain that is preventing access to more independence. One of our goals is to develop alternative behaviors to replace maladaptive ones that prevent an individual from accessing the community or more neuro-typical social environments. Not only do <b>ABS</b> programs rectify areas of weakness, but they use the child's strengths as tools in the process.
